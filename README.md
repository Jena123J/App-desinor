# App-desinor

App-desinor is a small collection of app design templates, example components, and starter code to help quickly prototype web or mobile app interfaces.

## Features
- Minimal starter templates for app UI and layout
- Example components and sample pages
- Simple, easy-to-adapt structure for prototypes and demos

## Getting started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Jena123J/App-desinor.git
   ```
2. Open the files in your editor or load the demo files in a browser. If the repo includes static assets (HTML/CSS/JS), you can run a simple local server:
   ```
   # from the project root
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Development
- Add new design templates under a clear folder structure (e.g., `templates/`, `components/`, `examples/`).
- Keep assets organized: `css/`, `js/`, `images/`.
- Use descriptive filenames and include a short README or demo file for each template.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome — please open an issue or submit a pull request. When contributing:
- Add tests or a demo for new templates if applicable.
- Keep commits small and focused with clear messages.

## License
Add your preferred license (e.g., MIT) to a `LICENSE` file. If you want, I can add a license for you.
